# Deploy Fix - Missing HTML Files in Production Build

## Issue
The production deployment was missing `about.html` and `analyzer.html` files in the build output, causing routing failures for the landing page.

## Root Cause
The previous deployment did not properly execute the full build process, resulting in incomplete file generation.

## Solution
This commit triggers a fresh deployment that will:
1. Run the complete Vite build process
2. Generate all three HTML entry points (index.html, about.html, analyzer.html)
3. Copy all files to the production build directory

## Verification
After deployment, verify all routes are accessible:
- `/` - Landing page
- `/about` - About page
- `/analyzer` - Analyzer page

## Build Command
The render.yaml configuration is correct:
```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build:render
```

This file can be removed after successful deployment.
